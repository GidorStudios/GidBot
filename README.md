# Gid Bot

This bot is heavily outdated, and was written with zero documentation (little or no commenting).
The bot was just a hobby project made for fun in the early days of 2018 and until 2021 then it wasn't maintained.
It's also not designed to be used as a template for other bots. It doesn't follow best practices in terms of code organization, because I started working on it
when I was still a begineer in python. It's not recommended to use this code as it may be difficult to understand for someone new to .
It's meant to be a starting point, not an example of how to write discord bot.

The bot was abandoned for these reasons above, and because I wanted to make a better more organized bot. Which now runs under the name Pulsar. 
The new bot has been built from the ground up. It uses the py-cord library instead of kinda abandoned discord.py. 
I recommend trying out the new bot.

The source code was still written in discord.py 1.7.3 and python 3.8 so keep that in mind, that it's deprecated.

## Update 2024.03.27: Made some changes to the code so it should work again.

# Setup

Download python 3.8 and install it.

Create an application on discord developers website and a bot user, copy the token of the bot.
Fill in the variables at the top of bot.py and install the requirements.txt from the folder.

Open cmd and type in this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now the bot should be ready to run. Type in this to run the bot.
```
py bot.py
```
