# Gid Bot

I created this bot when i was still a beginner at Python back in 2019, so it's not a masterpiece.
The bot got discontinued in late 2021, due to not meeting the requirements, and i wanted to make a better bot.
And here we are now, publishing the source code in the middle of 2022, don't expect it to be a fully functional bot, but 
it can get the job done for a server with friends and stuff.

The source code was still written in discord.py 1.7.3 and python 3.8 so keep that in mind, that it's deprecated.

A new bot are in the works and expected to release in 2022 summer.

# Setup

Create an application on discord developers website and a bot user.
Fill in the variables at the top of bot.py and install the requirements.txt from the folder.

Open cmd and type in this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now the bot should be ready to run. Type in this to run the bot.
```
py bot.py
```
